<h3> Description:</h3> <br>

This project is made with MVVM architecture. In this project i built a multi-screen app that shows the list of the friends that the user is connected. It also shows more information about the friends like- address, email, workplace ect. All those data are fecthed from server. Meanwhile this app call the api from the server with url string and fetch data, then decode the data and shows on the screens. 

<br>
<h3> What I Learned:</h3> <br>
Here i learned how receive data with the help of struct and urlsession. What is nested struct how to fetch data from a nested dictionary. how to show data of a server to multiple screen. 
<br>

<br> I also learned about completion handeller as data , response and error and how to identify errors. Here i used escaping.

As i continue to dig deeper and deeper into Codable, I found how flexible and safe it is.
